# Todo List

## Completed Tasks
- Fixed LoggingFilter order registration issue
  - Problem: Spring Security was not recognizing the @Order annotation on LoggingFilter
  - Solution: Implemented Ordered interface in LoggingFilter class to explicitly register its order
  - Details: Added getOrder() method returning -100 (same as @Order annotation value)

## Pending Improvements
- Consider using FilterRegistrationBean for more explicit filter registration
- Review other custom filters to ensure they have proper order registration
- Consider adding more comprehensive logging for security-related events
- Evaluate if the current filter order (-100 for LoggingFilter, -90 for RequestLoggingFilter) is optimal
