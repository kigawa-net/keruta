## Completed Tasks

- Fixed LoggingFilter order registration issue
    - Problem: Spring Security was not recognizing the @Order annotation on LoggingFilter
    - Solution: Implemented Ordered interface in LoggingFilter class to explicitly register its order
    - Details: Added getOrder() method returning -100 (same as @Order annotation value)
