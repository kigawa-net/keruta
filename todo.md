# Todo List

- structure.mdの改善

## Completed Tasks

- Removed API authentication requirement
    - Change: Removed token-based authentication from all API endpoints
    - Details: Removed token field from Client struct, removed Authorization headers from all API requests, and updated configuration to not require a token
    - Reason: Simplified API access by removing authentication requirement

- Fixed LoggingFilter order registration issue
    - Problem: Spring Security was not recognizing the @Order annotation on LoggingFilter
    - Solution: Implemented Ordered interface in LoggingFilter class to explicitly register its order
    - Details: Added getOrder() method returning -100 (same as @Order annotation value)
